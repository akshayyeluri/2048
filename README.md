# 2048
My version of 2048, implemented in python using the graphics library tkinter. First project I ever did.
Since it was for a class, there's a lot of details and other notes in the comments that are not relevant to anything anymore.

There are two versions of the game, player.py and fancyPlayer.py ("$ python player.py" will run the first version, and likewise for the second). The fancy player just implements sliding, but is otherwise very similar.
